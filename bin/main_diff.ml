Whenever there is a sequence of [collapse_threshold] or more unchanged lines, we collapse
them and only show the first [num_shown] and the last [num_shown] of these lines.

Like the unix diff utility, this command exits non-zero (with exit code 2) when its inputs
are different, so it can be used as a sexp equality test with the -quiet flag.  Passing
the -for-patch flag disables this behavior.

It also exists non-zero (with exit code 1) if either sexp is malformed.
