"Implementation of a subset of CSS-style selectors for traversing sexp trees.

See also the get and query subcommands.

Syntax:
- "foo" finds the value of every pair in your tree having "foo" as the key
- "foo bar" finds the value of every pair in your tree having "foo" as the
  key, and then for each of these trees finds the value of every pair having
  "bar" as the key.
- "foo > bar" finds the value of every pair in your tree having "foo" as the
  key, and then for each of these trees finds the value of every top-level pair
  having "bar" as the key.
- "foo > ( bar baz )" finds the value of every pair in your tree having "foo" as the
  key, and then for each of these trees finds the value of every top-level pair
  having either "bar" or "baz" as the key.
- "*" matches anything
