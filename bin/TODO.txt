add more tests for to-csv

new query commands
    (split ,)       "one,two,three" => { ("one" "two" "three") }
    (merge ,)       ("one" "two" "three") => "one,two,three"
    (match PAT)     (match ".*\.PK") matches

variations on existing query command
    (smash NUM)     never remove any more than N parens
    (equal A B C)   (or (equal A) (equal B) (equal C))
    (index -2)      (a b c d) => c

add commands
    sexp set        bundled-in sexpset.exe as requested by ralph
    sexp print      basically just 'sexp query this' (same back-end)
    sexp of-csv     reverse of to-csv

add additional options for (of/to)-csv commands

    support for "2D array" sexps ((a b c) (1 2 3))
    optional header record in the CSV

rethink command names
    s/test/grep/ (?)
    ... I think I like this better the longer I think about it

work out the algebra of commands (what laws hold)

some recursion combinator?
    one that doesn't introduce non-termination?
