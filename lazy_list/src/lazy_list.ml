let lazy_sort ~cmp zlst =
  (* This is a stable, O(N log N) worst-case, merge sort.  It has the
   * additional useful property that forcing the first element only takes
   * O(N) time, and forcing each additional element only takes O(log N)
   * time, meaning it is worthwhile to sort a lazy list even if you only
   * want the first few elements.
   *
   * The basic strategy is as follows: we convert the lazy list into a
   * (normal) list of one element long lazy lists.  We then go through
   * merging pairs of lazy lists together, into 2 element long lazy lists,
   * then 4 element long lazy lists, etc., until we merge all the lists
   * back into one big list (that is now in sorted order).
   *
   * In building the final list, we end up creating about 2N intermediate
   * lists (2N-1, I think).  Forcing the first element forces the first
   * element of all of these lists, meaning that it is O(N) cost to do so.
   * But we only remove the heads of O(log N) of these lists (those lists
   * whose head element is the head element of the sorted list)- so forcing
   * the second element only takes O(log N) work.  And so on for the third
   * element, etc.
