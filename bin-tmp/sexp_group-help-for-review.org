* sexp_group.exe

: group input sexps by an arbitrary key
:
:   sexp_group.exe
:
: Groups a list of s-expressions. The group key can be specified in a variety of formats:
: a field name, a query as used for sexp query, a pattern as used for sexp pat-query,
: a path as used for sexp get, or a CSS-style program as used for sexp select.
:
: For each unique key in the input, one record-style sexp will be outputted with three
: keys: "key", containing the common key for the grouped values; "values", containing
: the list of grouped values; and "count", the number of grouped values.
:
: The output groups will be sorted in order of appearance of each key, and the list of
: values for each key will be in the same order as in the input.
:
: You can group by multiple keys, in which case the "key" in the output will be a list
: containing each individual key. You can specify multiple keys by passing the same
: selector format multiple times, e.g., "-field foo -field bar", or, if you want to use
: multiple kinds of selectors, by using the special "-key" flag (see below).
:
: Missing keys can be handled in various ways by using the "-if-no-key" flag. By default
: input sexps with missing keys will cause an error. By passing "-if-no-key drop", inputs
: with missing keys will be dropped from the input. Missing keys can also just be treated
: as units ( "()" ) by passing "-if-no-key unit".
:
: When using "-if-no-key unit", there is no way to disambiguate between a missing key
: and an actual unit. If an actual unit is seen in the input, an error will be thrown.
: To resolve this, there are two options:
:   - "-if-no-key wrap" will wrap all keys in an outer sexp, so that actual unit keys
:     become "(())", while missing keys are "()".
:   - "-if-no-key force-unit" will simply treat all missing keys as units, even if some
:     keys are actual units.
:
: To specify multiple keys that use different access formats, or if you want to specify
: different handling of missing values for each key, use the "-key" flag and pass a
: string of the form "<access_kind><modifiers>:<arg>", where:
:   - <access_kind> is one of (field|index|query|pat-query|get|select)
:   - <modifiers> are optional strings to control specific sort behavior for that column.
:     Each modifier is prefixed with a '/'. Options are:
:       mfail  -> raise an error if the key is missing (default)
:       mdrop  -> drop sexps with missing keys from the output
:       munit  -> treat missing keys as unit ( "()" )
:       mwrap  -> wrap all keys in an outer sexp; missing keys are units ( "()" )
:       mforceunit -> treat missing keys as unit; even if there are actual unit keys
:   - <arg> is the arg you would pass to the equivalent "-<access_kind>" flag.
